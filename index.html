                  NSS(National Service Scheme) is the largest social service group in India. It operates in multiple universities. I have worked in NSS IITR in my first year and later joined again in 3rd year as an English editorial head. 
                    I lead a team of 30 students, and we work on different issues to highlight the problems of our society as well as work to solve them.

                <h4>Web Developer</h4>
                <p>
                  Sangram is the annual sports fest organised by the sports council of IIT Roorkee. I was part of the team that developed the
                    website for Sangram-2019. My job was to design and develop the frontend of website so that it would be easy and hassle free for
                    students to register for the event.
                    TApart from HTML and CSS which I already knew the project introduced me to new and powerful tools in web development such as PHP,Javascript,ReactJS
                    etc.

                <p>
                    Student Club IIT Roorkee provides recreational services both free and paid. Paid services include Billiards,8-Ball Pool,Playstation
                    and free services include Table tennis,Chess,carrom etc. During peak hours the rush at the club is huge and sometimes students go back
                    disappointed having to come from distance and check for the availability of the services. To solve the problem a team was created to 
                    create a website that would give the live status of occupancy and availability of services. Furthermore students could also book the 
                    services online. I was the executive member of team and my task was to handle the front end and make the site responsive and also to
                    find the suitable payment gateway for smooth and less deductible transactions. The challenge was to make site attractive as well as 
                    easy to use. I had to learn the basics of ReactJS and update my prior knowledge of web development to do my task.
